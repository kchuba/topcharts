Week 1:

This week I created my page using CSS and JavaScript. I used CSS to create a header and 10 different sections for the top 10 songs. I used JavaScript to create clickable images that will reveal facts about the song/artist, and I used JavaScript to add in Highcharts. I used all dummy images, text and charts because I am putting in the exact info next week and was just setting up the layout this week - I only built out two of the sections because you had said in your comment only to do two to start.The only thing I didn't do was a map - I decided it junked up the page a little too much and didn't really add any important info, so I'll just be using the charts. I used many of the previous assignments to figure these steps out, including Highcharts and CSS tutorials you provided earlier in the course. I'm pleased with visually how the page looks, and when I put the actual info and pictures in next week I'm going to try to add more JavaScript to make the page even more interactive, likely with hiding/showing the audio clip and adding more text to move around the page.
